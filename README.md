Web Search Engine
====================

We are trying to build a fully functional web search engine. We have implemented several key components of a search engine, including   
* Ranker
* Indexer
* Evaluator

### Indexer
The indexer will go over the corpus and build posting lists for every term. Key features including:
* Simple External Sort
* Byte Encoding / Decoding
* Linear & Binary Search for Terms
* Stemming 

### Ranker  
We have built several rankers including:  
* Cosine Similarity Ranker
* Query Likelihood Ranker
